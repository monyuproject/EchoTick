    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>6) Data stored on your device</h2>
    <p>

    </p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). If you believe a child has

    </ul>

    <h2>10) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards appropriate for the type of data handled. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>11) International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      If advertising services are used, data may be processed by Google and its partners in countries other than yours.
      They use their own safeguards as described in their policies.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
